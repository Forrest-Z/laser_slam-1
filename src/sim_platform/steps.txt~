7. rosrun sim_platform path_planner.py

Notes: 
  1. Ensure that the robot tracks with a close path without any intersection between two lines.
  2. After a close path was drawn , the path_planner would publish the waypoints path and meanwhile send goal to move_base server.
  3. We can use these topics including /heatmap_area as a close path area and /visualization_path as a waypoints path in rviz.
